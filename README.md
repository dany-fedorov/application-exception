## Motivation

> *"Programs that use exceptions as part of their normal processing suffer from all the readability and
> maintainability problems of classic spaghetti code."*
> â€” Andy Hunt, Dave Thomas - The Pragmatic Programmer

It is hard to disagree with software engineering classics. Nevertheless, many times I found myself reimplementing the
same pattern where
thrown exceptions signify diversion from happy path and carry more information than `message` and `stack` found on
the `Error` class.

I think there is nothing wrong with implementing this each time for every new project, because
different projects are going to have different exceptions. And the citation above hints that I find it preferable to
handle as many exceptions as possible with normal control flow.

The use case for this library that I have in mind is an application back-end which is a thin layer over one or more data
sources (e.g. a databases or third-party APIs) and you throw exceptions expecting a front-end to handle them. It is
likely that in case of working on a project like this you also win more from delivering quickly then you win from
writing exceptional quality code.

I'll be happy if this library is useful for somebody except myself, but please make sure that you really need it.

## Features

- Provides a selection of fields most likely to be useful when building an API back-end or a CLI program
- Builder pattern
- Provides a JSON representation available with `toJSON` method
- Configurable with good defaults

## Guide

### Defaults

By default `ApplicationException` sets `id`, `timestamp` and `message` fields.

(Run
with `npm run ts-file ./examples/default-fields-example.ts` or see
example's [source code](./examples/default-fields-example.ts))

```typescript
const e = AppEx.new();

console.log('id:'.padEnd(10), e.getId());
console.log('timestamp:'.padEnd(10), e.getTimestamp());
console.log('message:'.padEnd(10), e.getMessage());
```

prints

```text
Id:        AE_01GP7M92ZN5NZ48HN9ZECTB9WC
Timestamp: 2023-01-08T02:45:12.309Z
Message:   Something went wrong
```

You can provide a custom message to `ApplicationException.new`.

(Run
with `npm run ts-file ./examples/default-fields-with-custom-message-example.ts` or see
example's [source code](./examples/default-fields-with-custom-message-example.ts))

```typescript
const e = AppEx.new(`I'm an error message`);

console.log('id:'.padEnd(10), e.getId());
console.log('timestamp:'.padEnd(10), e.getTimestamp());
console.log('message:'.padEnd(10), e.getMessage());
```

prints

```text
id:        AE_01GP7MKS25TSY4CN6QWZ64P4PS
timestamp: 2023-01-08T02:51:02.597Z
message:   I'm an error message
```
